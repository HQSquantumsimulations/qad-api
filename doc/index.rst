Welcome to QAD-API's documentation!
===================================

QAD-API is a python library to access QAD cloud developed by HQS Quantum Simulations.

QAD-API currently provides access to the lattice model solver (SCCE) in a very similar way to how you access it using the web-based frontend:

1. Authorise with the QAD cloud backend (using your existing QAD cloud user account)

2. List, create and delete unit-cells, systems and jobs in your user account

3. Wait for a job to complete and download the result

For more information see the detailed code documentation below
